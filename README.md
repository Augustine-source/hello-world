# hello-world

Hi there!

About me, I like javascript and it's kinnda like the only programming laguage i'm aquainted to at the moment.
I've ome this far (not so far though) to realize how fun programming can be.
I'm really grateful about finding coding in the first place, and i do hope to get better at this shit some day!
